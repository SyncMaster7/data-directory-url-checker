# data-directory-url-checker
This is a url checker for a specific jira-insight data directory.

Problem to solve.

There is a data directory in jira-insight that has thousands (20'000+) of url links. And the problem is that in time these links may have changed or get broken somehow. Therefore there is a need for a script or a program that checkes these links - wheter they are working or not. Working url - in current context means a url that is pingable and does not return 404 Not found error.

In order to solve the problem, I have decided to use Java (I have my reasons).
