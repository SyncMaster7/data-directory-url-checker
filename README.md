# data-directory-url-checker
This is a url checker for a specific jira-insight data directory.

## Problem to solve.

There is a data directory in jira-insight that has thousands 20'000+ of url links. And the problem is that in time
these links may have changed or get broken somehow. Therefore there is a need for a script or a program that checks
these links - whether they are working or not. Working url - in current context means a url that **is pingable** and
**does not return 404 'Not found' error**.

>In order to solve the problem, I have decided to use Java (I have my reasons).
